# Uncommon C Pointer Behavior

This repository demonstrates a simple yet potentially confusing aspect of pointer manipulation in C. The `bug.c` file contains code that initializes an integer, creates a pointer to it, and then modifies the value through the pointer. While this works as expected in most cases, it serves as a starting point for discussions on memory management and pointer-related pitfalls.
